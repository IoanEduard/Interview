    Prim's algorithm - How to find min ST
      Remove all the loops (edge coming back to same vertex)
      Remove pararell edges
         - keep the edge with minimum weight
      Choose any vertex as root node
      Choose (A) node
         we check all the outgoing/incident edges and choose the edge with minimum weight
      A -> B (weight 7)
      B -> C, w = 3
      C -> E, w = 3
      E -> F, w = 2
      E -> D, w = 2

      G(v,e)
      G'(v',e')
         v'= v
         e'= subset of e
         e'=|v|-1
