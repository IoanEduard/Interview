Cg (v,e)
   spanning tree of this graph would contain
      G'(v', e')

   relationship is:
   v' = v
   difference is in the number of edges
   e' subset of e
   e' = |v| - 1 
   edges equal vertexes - 1

   A graph can have more than 1 spanning tree
      lets say edges have weights
      the minimum spanning tree is with minimum sum of weights

           3 --- 4

   spanning tree is vertexes minus 1
   e.g 1

            1
          /   \
       1 /     \ 2
        /       \

          \      |
           3     4

   e.g 2

            1
          /   \
       1 /     \ 2
        /       \

   Minimum spanning tree properties:
      - should not contain cycles or be disconnected
      - removing one edge from ST will make it disconnected
      - adding one edge to the ST will make it a loop
      - if each edge has distinct weights then there will be only one unique MST
      - a complete undirected graph can have n^n-2 no. of ST
      - every connected and undirected graph has at least one ST
      - disconnected graph does not have any ST
      - from complete graph by removing max(e-n+1) edges we can construct a ST

                          1                  1               1
                         / \         =>     /       =>        \
                        /   \              /                   \
                       2     3            2 --- 3         2 --- 3

         e-n+1 = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1


         For 4 edges
         n^n-2 = 4^4-2 = 16 possible ST

         e-n+1 = 6-4+1 = 3 we can remove maximum 3 edges
