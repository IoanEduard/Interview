        Kruska'l algorithm - Finding min ST
         Remove all the loops (edge coming back to same vertex)
         Remove pararell edges
            - keep the edge with minimum weight
         We arrange all edges according to their edge weight, in increasing order of their edge weight

         (B, D) = 2
         (D, E) = 2
         (A, C) = 3
         (C, D) = 3
         (B, E) = 4
         (A, B) = 5
         (B, C) = 6
         (A, F) = 7
         (F, C) = 8

         We choose the edge with minimum weight from this set above:

         (B, D) = 2
         (D, E) = 2
         (A, C) = 3
         (C, D) = 3
         (B, E) = we cannot connect this because it will form a cycle 
         (A, B) = contains cycle
         (B, C) = contains cycle
         (A, F) = 7
         (F, C) = contains cycle

         Must containg n vertexes and n-1 edges
