1 -> 2 w = 9
1 -> 3 w = -4
2 -> 1 w = 6
3 -> 2 w = 5
4 -> 3 w = 1

We have to find "All Pair Shortest Path"
For example we take vertex 1 as a source vertex and we find shortest distance to each vertex
 
1 -> 2
  -> 3
  -> 4

2 -> 1
  -> 3
  -> 4

3 -> 1
  -> 2
  -> 3

4 -> 1
  -> 2
  -> 3

  All Pairs shortest path problem
  Dijsktra algorithm would find shortest path from a given source 
  Using Dijsktra algorithm for this case we would have to apply it 4 times to find All pair shortest path

  Floyd Warshall is using DP technique, breaking down a big problem into smaller problems
    - works on positive and negative weights
