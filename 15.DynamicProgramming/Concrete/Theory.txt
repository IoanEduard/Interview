Problem 1: Fibonaci
Write a function fib(n) that takes a number as an argument
The fuction should return the n-th number of the fibonacci sequence
The 1st and 2nd number of the sequence is 1
To generate the next number of the sequence, we sum the previous two

e.g. n = 7
n:      1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
fib(n): 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34
