Part 1: Memoization
Part 2: Tabulation

Problem 1: Fibonaci
Write a function fib(n) that takes a number as an argument
The fuction should return the n-th number of the fibonacci sequence
The 1st and 2nd number of the sequence is 1
To generate the next number of the sequence, we sum the previous two

e.g. n = 7
n:      1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
fib(n): 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34

Tabulation Recipe
visualize the problem as a table
size the table based on the inputs
initialize the table with default values
seed the trivial answer into the table
iterate through the table
fill further positions based on the current position
