this isn't a traditional page to fetch the request for a html page
javascript runs in the browser on the loaded page. 
We can manipulate DOM so we don't have to send requests for html pages
We only make requests for the data
We can do from scratch with javascript but it isn't practical
Vue gives a clear ruleset we can follow so we focus on business logic

We don't have to control everything in a html page but we can control parts of the page
We can control everything on a page. SPA page, server only sends one HTML page, after that VUE takes over and control the UI
