Binary Tree
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAAZixBzIAI

Terminology:
Parent, Child, Nodes, Root (No parent), Leaf (No Children)
Binary tree has two children or 1
Exactly 1 path between root and any node, one single path guarenteed
Edge cases: Empty trees, one node, two nodes still considered a binary tree
            Cycle within the structure is not a binary tree
