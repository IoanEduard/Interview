.NET devs take it for granted, its a managed code

What is GC
GC is the processing of cleaning up unused memory inside a .NET process
The CLR (Common Language Runtime) allocates memory into the managed heap when an object is created
Since memory is a finite resource, hence it needs to be freed up at some point in time based on availability. That is where the phenomenon of GC happens.

Garbage Collection
- is the component responsible for automatic memory management inside the CLR
Developers does not have to manange memory
Memory allocation is efficient 
Provides more safety in terms of making sure one object cannot use content of another
Finds out and cleans unused memory automatically

The mananged Heap
The CLR  does memory allocation in a contiguous memory space of the process, which is known as the mananged heap
